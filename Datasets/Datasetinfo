# Datasets
•	The UAE_NO2_SO2_Aerosol_Combined_2023_2025.tif dataset is a georeferenced multi-band raster file containing atmospheric pollution indicators across the United Arab Emirates from 2023 to 2025. It includes three spatial layers: NO₂ column number density, SO₂ column number density, and the absorbing aerosol index (AAI), each represented as a separate band with a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km. The data is structured in WGS 84 geographic coordinates (EPSG:4326) and spans latitudes 22.62° to 26.08° and longitudes 51.53° to 56.39°. While it does not include explicit administrative boundaries or city labels, the dataset can be overlaid with geospatial layers to analyze air quality variations across urban and rural areas such as Dubai, Sharjah, and Abu Dhabi.

•	The UAE_NO2_SO2_Aerosol_Combined_2020_2022.tif dataset is a geospatial raster file comprising three atmospheric pollution indicators across the United Arab Emirates for the years 2020 to 2022. It includes three distinct bands: NO₂ column number density, SO₂ column number density, and absorbing aerosol index (AAI), each capturing the spatial distribution of these pollutants at a high resolution of approximately 1 km. Georeferenced in WGS 84 coordinates (EPSG:4326), the dataset spans key urban and rural regions, allowing for integration with other spatial layers to assess environmental patterns over time. This combined format facilitates comparative analysis and long-term monitoring of air quality across the UAE.

•	The AE Region Mobility Report (2020–2022) dataset is a comprehensive compilation of mobility trends across various emirates in the United Arab Emirates, including Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ajman, Fujairah, and Ras al Khaimah. Derived from Google's Community Mobility Reports, the dataset tracks changes in visits to key location categories such as retail, parks, workplaces, transit stations, and residential areas. Covering the period from February 2020 to October 2022, it provides valuable insights into behavioral shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery phases. Each record includes mobility metrics along with the corresponding year, allowing for temporal comparisons and long-term trend analysis.

•	The Combined OpenAQ Measurements dataset contains 88,000 rows of air quality data collected from various monitoring locations, primarily across the United Arab Emirates. It includes key pollutants such as NO₂, O₃, PM₁₀, SO₂, and CO, along with associated metadata like timestamps, units, geographic coordinates, and monitoring source details. With 15 columns, the dataset captures both UTC and local datetimes, whether a sensor is mobile or stationary, and the identity of the data provider. This dataset is well-suited for temporal and spatial analysis of air quality trends, and can be integrated with mobility, meteorological, or urban datasets for deeper environmental insight. 

•	The Ericsson Mobility Forecast dataset provides high-level projections of mobile network trends across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, with a focus on 2023 to 2025. It includes detailed metrics such as mobile data traffic volumes (in exabytes/month), 5G traffic share, Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) usage, and GCC-specific 5G penetration rates. With just 12 entries, the dataset is structured for trend analysis rather than granular breakdowns, making it ideal for contextualizing and validating observed mobility and air quality patterns in the UAE. It serves as a reliable reference for aligning local findings with broader regional and global digital infrastructure trends.

•	The Landsat–SRTM Merged Metadata dataset contains detailed geospatial and temporal metadata for 6,265 satellite scenes, combining Landsat optical imagery and SRTM elevation data. Spanning 79 columns, it includes acquisition details, geographic coordinates of scene corners, cloud cover, resolution, satellite and sensor identifiers, processing software versions, and projection systems. This metadata serves as a valuable index for selecting and analyzing imagery based on spatial extent, acquisition timing, or environmental quality. Although specific locations and date ranges were not available in the provided metadata, the dataset is well-structured for supporting terrain-aware remote sensing analysis, land classification, and environmental change detection across the UAE or other areas of interest.
