# Title: Urban Mobility and Air Quality in UAE Cities: A Satellite-Driven Comparative Analysis
Urban air quality in rapidly growing cities is increasingly shaped by human mobility, land use, and infrastructure density. This study presents a comparative geospatial analysis of mobility patterns and atmospheric pollution across four major UAE cities—Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and Al Ain—using integrated satellite and open-source datasets. We propose a two-phase methodology: (1) a retrospective analysis from 2020 to 2022 using high-resolution NO₂, SO₂, and aerosol data from Sentinel-5P combined with Google Mobility Reports and OpenAQ ground sensors; and (2) a forecast-based scenario from 2023 to 2025 utilizing projected pollution data and Ericsson’s regional mobility forecasts. Cities are subdivided into geohash zones to enable uniform spatial analysis. Exploratory data analysis, clustering, and regression modeling are used to identify pollution hotspots, quantify mobility-pollution correlations, and highlight zones with potential for clean transport interventions. The findings provide data-driven insights into the urban environmental dynamics of the UAE and offer a scalable framework for smart city planning and policy prioritization in similar rapidly urbanizing contexts.
